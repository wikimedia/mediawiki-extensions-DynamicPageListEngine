* The new class [[{{NAMESPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Extrax|DynamicPageListEngineFeatureExtrax]] does for [[{{NAMESPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Category|DynamicPageListEngineFeatureContains]] what [[{{NAMESPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Extrax|DynamicPageListEngineFeatureExtra]] does for [[{{NAMESPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Category|DynamicPageListEngineFeatureCategory]].
